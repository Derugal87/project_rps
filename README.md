## Project Description
The project is about building rock, paper, scissors game is a simple two-player game where each player chooses one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The game rules dictate that rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

#### Considerations
- Ensuring that each player's move is committed
- Ensuring the privacy of the first move by hiding it until the second move is made or the reveal step occurs.
- Allowing multiple players to play the game simultaneously while ensuring that the rules are enforced and that the outcome of each game is determined correctly
